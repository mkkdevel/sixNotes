 #### iCloud Sync ####
 
 In sixNotes you can sync your note content and color across all your iOS devices. 
 Due to different screen sizes, font size is not synced.
 
 To turn on/off iCloud sync use the longTap menu. 
 
 **Warning:** If you have content in the same note on different devices, sixNotes uses always the last modified note.
    So older content will be deleted.
